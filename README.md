✨ QuickDesk: A Simple Help Desk Solution ✨
🚀 Introduction
QuickDesk is a straightforward, single-page help desk application designed to streamline the process of managing support tickets. Created as a hackathon project, its primary goal is to provide a clean and efficient platform where end-users can easily submit and track their issues, while support agents and administrators can manage and resolve them. The application is built to be modern, responsive, and easy to use on any device.

🌟 Features
QuickDesk includes key functionalities for all user roles to ensure smooth operations:

User Authentication: 🔐 Secure registration and login for all users.

Role-Based Access: The application distinguishes between three user types:

End Users: 👤 Can create new tickets, view the status of their submitted tickets, and participate in conversations.

Support Agents: 👨‍💼 Can view all tickets, update their status (Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed), and add comments to provide assistance.

Admin: 👑 Has all agent capabilities plus the ability to manage user roles and ticket categories.

Ticket Management:

📝 Create: Users can create tickets with a subject, description, and category.

🔍 View & Filter: A centralized dashboard allows for easy viewing of all tickets with robust filtering and sorting options.

Conversation Timeline: 💬 Each ticket has a dedicated detail view with a threaded conversation to track all updates and comments.

Voting System: 👍👎 End users can upvote or downvote questions.

Category Management: 📂 Administrators can create, edit, and delete ticket categories.

💻 Technology Stack
This project is a single-file web application built with modern web technologies:

Frontend:

🌐 HTML5: The core structure of the application.

🎨 CSS3 & Tailwind CSS: Provides a professional, mobile-first design with utility-first styling for a sleek user interface.

💡 JavaScript (ES6+): Manages all application logic, state, and user interactions.

Backend & Database:

🔐 Firebase Authentication: Handles user registration, login, and session management.

💾 Firebase Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database used to store all tickets, users, and categories in real-time.

🛠️ Getting Started
To run this application, you only need a modern web browser. The code is a self-contained HTML file.

📥 Clone the repository:

git clone [repository-url]

📄 Open the file: Open index.html in your web browser.

The application is designed to work with Firebase's environment variables for authentication and Firestore access. If you're running this locally outside of a supported environment, you'll need to replace the placeholder variables (__firebase_config, __app_id, __initial_auth_token) with your own Firebase project credentials to enable full functionality.
